# Javascript and classes

# is javascript has classes ? No

# but we can create a class using function constructor.

# OOP => Object oriented program

# object => collections of the properties and the methods,

# why to use oop ?

# parts of the oop => constructor , prototype ,

# 4 pillars of the oops

1. Abstractions
   => This features allows the hide the complex functionality and provide only necessary functions
   example : define the function and classes

2) Encapsulation
   => It's about hiding the internal state of an object from outside world.
   example: private variable in javascript

3) Inheritance
   => A feature that allow us to create new objects based on existing ones, by defining new objects
   that are a modified version of pre-existing objects.
   example : extend or inherit the parent class into child class .

4) Polymorphism
   => It means that one object may be treated as different types of objects. The data and behavior of
   an object may vary depending upon how it is referenced or used.
   example : overloading method / overriding method

# new

=> it is used to create a instances of the object and functions

# constructor function

# constructor function is used to create new instances of the function or objects using the new keyword

# one drawback is that each instance gets its own copy of the methods, which may not be memory-efficient for large numbers of instances

# constructor property => this is the reference to its own object or functions

# Notes

1 We can add the custom property and function to an object like Object.prototype.sayhello
2 When we add the custom property and function to an Array/string/object it is not access to other data's
3 Function constructor is used to create new object function using Function() COnstructor with the new operator
4 The Function constructor creates a function which has global scope

# Inheritance

In JavaScript, inheritance is a mechanism that allows one object to inherit properties and methods from another object.

// # 1. Stash your changes
git stash

# 2. Create and switch to a new branch

git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

# 3. Work on your new branch, make changes, commit, etc.

# 4. When you're ready to go back to the original branch:

# Switch back to the original branch

git checkout <original-branch-name>

# 5. Apply the stash to the original branch

git stash apply
