/**
 * 1)Javascript  is synchronous by default 
 * 2)Js is the single threaded language 
 * 2)what is the synchronous language ?
 * => Block the code of execution or code runs in a particular sequence of the instructions given in the 
 *    program .each instructions waits for the execution of previous instruction to  complete its execution 
 * or each operation waits for the last oe to complete before executing 
 * 3)what is single threaded ?
 * =>The only one call stack is used to execute the program  or The only one line of code execute at once
 * 4) what is Asynchronous ? 
 * => It means that it does not block other operations while waiting for an event to occur.
 * => It means that it does not block other processes. It allows multiple operations to be performed simultaneously,
 * =>Non-blocking, event driven programming model where multiple operations can occur simultaneously.
